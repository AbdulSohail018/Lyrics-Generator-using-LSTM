# Lyrics Generator using LSTM
**Project Overview:** <br/>
This project focuses on generating song lyrics using Neural Network concepts, specifically leveraging Natural Language Generation techniques. The traditional process of lyric writing involves meticulous word selection for rhyming and overall appeal. To simplify this, I developed a Lyrics Generator program using Natural Language Generation.

**Key Features:** <br/>
**Input:** Takes the corpus of a song as input for generating lyrics. <br/>
**Output:** Generates a song containing words from the given corpus. <br/>
**Rhyming:** Capable of producing rhyming words suitable for the song. <br/>

# Approach
**Algorithm Comparison** <br/>
Identified flaws in existing algorithms (Hidden Markov Model, Feed Forward NN, RNN) and addressed them using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) to enhance the lyric generation process.

**Corpus Selection** <br/>
Utilized the music lyrics of songs in the top 100 lists of Spotify year-end songs (1955-2015) as the lyrics corpus. This specific language and structural choice aimed to enhance the model's effectiveness.

**Efficiency** <br/>
Focused on the top 100 songs to manage data size, ensuring efficient training without compromising model quality.

# How to Use <br/>
1. Provide the song corpus as input.
2. Receive a generated song that incorporates words from the corpus.
3. Enjoy the ease and inspiration provided for developing captivating lyrics.

# Note
-> This project aims to assist lyricists by streamlining the songwriting process. <br/>
-> LSTM is employed to overcome flaws in existing algorithms. <br/>
-> The corpus choice ensures domain-specific language and structure compatibility. <br/>
